Evan Camp's Presentation Topic:

Travel Tips for newbie travelers. Having done a fair amount of international/domestic travel, I will offer some tips and tricks to expedite and streamline the process.
These will range from the obvious (pack your chargers) to the slightly more obscure (pack an extra change of clothes in your carry-on).
Will also include a couple of recommendations based upon my past travel experiences and some pros and cons of common travel destinations.
