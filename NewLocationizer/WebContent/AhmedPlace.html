	<h1>Yellowstone national park</h1>

	<p>
		Yellowstone national park is one of my all-time favorite places.
	</p>

	<p>
		With colorful hot springs, mudpots, and geysers, and wide open green spaces, Yellowstone park is easy on
		the eye and smell.
	</p>

	<p>
		It also serves as a home to amazing wild creatures such as bears, elk, and bison.
