				All you have to learn here is how to have fun. This is truly an almighty mountain. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.

				This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

				You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.

				Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. We don't have anything but happy trees here. What the devil. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?

				Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Here's something that's fun. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.

				Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Just make a decision and let it go. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.

				You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Poor old tree. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.
