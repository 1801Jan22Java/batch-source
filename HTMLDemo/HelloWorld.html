            <p class="bobRoss">Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>
            
            <p class="bobRoss">I get carried away with this brush cleaning. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>
                    
            <p class="bobRoss">If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. We'll have a super time. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.</p>
