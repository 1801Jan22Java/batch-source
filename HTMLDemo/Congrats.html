		<div class="textDiv col-md-4">We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.

		You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. We need dark in order to show light. We'll have a super time.</div>

		<div class="textDiv col-md-4">Let's make a happy little mountain now. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Learn when to stop. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We can fix anything.

		Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Just make little strokes like that.</div>	
		<br>
		<div class="textDiv col-md-4">Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. At home you have unlimited time. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

		Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Let that brush dance around there and play. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. A little happy sunlight shining through there.</div>
