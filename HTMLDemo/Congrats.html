                    A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.

                    Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
