		 * This code is very incomplete. Things which it lacks include:
		 * 1) A Driver
		 * 2) A means to iterate the oneAways check.
		 * 3) A data structure capable of handling the multiple stringArrays returned by oneAways checks
		 * 4) A comparison to the desired end string.
		 * 5) A counter to count the number of iterations of oneAways checks.
		 * 6) A way to choose the shortest path (by returning the smallest oneAways path).
		 * 
		 * Things to do differently:
		 * spend less time focusing on nonessentials
		 * get core program to work
