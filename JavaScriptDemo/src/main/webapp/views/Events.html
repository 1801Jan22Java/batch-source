				We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around 
				and having fun. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in 
				my life - to be able to share this with you. This is your creation
				- and it's just as unique and special as you are. Tree trunks 
				grow however makes them happy. Just beat the devil out of it. 
				Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?

				This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, 
				a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. When 
				things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let's put 
				some happy little bushes on the other side now. Fluff that up. 
				It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.
