			when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We don't
			want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little
			Evergreen that lives here. If it's not what you want - stop and
			change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Learn
			when to stop. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being
			able to express yourself to others through painting. We need dark in
			order to show light. The first step to doing anything is to believe
			you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. I
			get carried away with this brush cleaning. You don't have to be crazy
			to do this but it does help. You can do it. Painting should do one
			thing. It should put happiness in your heart. You gotta think like a
			tree. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.

			It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.
			Clouds are free they come and go as they please. This piece of canvas
			is your world. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my
			coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. You can get away with a
			lot. Trees grow however makes them happy. Just relax and let it flow.
			That easy. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. All
			kinds of happy little splashes. Volunteering your time; it pays you
			and your whole community fantastic dividends. Be brave. Just think
			about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. There is no
			right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt
			anyone. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes
			you happy then it's good. We'll make some happy little bushes here.
			As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Work that paint.
			There comes a nice little fluffer. If you don't like it - change it.
			It's your world.</p>
